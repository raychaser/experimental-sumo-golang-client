# WARNING

This is an initial **EXPERIMENTAL** attempt at creating both
Sumo Logic API bindings for Golang as well as an actual CLI
to interact with the Sumo Logic service.

Please consider this "my first Go project"––the author is NOT
a professional Go programmer. However, an attempt was made to
follow best practices for building API and CLI clients.

At this point this code is not meant for production use. This
code is **NOT** an official product of Sumo Logic.
